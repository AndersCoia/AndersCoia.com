                <h1>Message From the Head of School</h1>
                <p>On behalf of the ANU School of Art & Design, I am delighted to share with you the work of our 2021 graduating cohort, spanning visual arts, design, art history and curatorship.
                    During the past two years, both Higher Education and the Arts have been heavily impacted by the pandemic. However, throughout these turbulent times, our students have sustained an unyielding commitment to their studies. Despite pauses, flips, petitions and pivots, they have worked to create, make and design no matter the circumstance. This exhibition is a celebration of their practice, achievements, creativity, fortitude and flexibility.                 
                    Please take your time as you navigate the showcase. Our student body is diverse and talented, and the work shared illustrates their creative and academic range. You can explore the site by graduate name (select Graduates and search A-Z) or by searching a particular technique or discipline (e.g. Glass, Wire Weaving, Oil Painting, Print, Sculpture, Digital Video, etc).                    
                    As we celebrate and congratulate our emerging graduates, please show your support by following and sharing their social media accounts, buying artwork or commissioning new work. You can contribute to that next step, to help our emerging graduates launch their professional selves beyond the academe.
                </p>

                <h1>About the Exhibition</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Australian National University School of Art and Design 2021 Graduating Exhibition.
                    The exhibition showcases the work of students completing undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs at the School. The show is a culmination of years of study in art, design, art history and art theory. It represents the successful resolution of thought processes, skills and making, working across disciplines, showcasing creativity, strength of ideas and reflecting the exceptional teaching and learning at the School.
                    In 2021, the Graduating Exhibition will take place online. This platform offers the opportunity for graduating students to showcase their work to wider audiences, whilst providing insight into their individual practice and learning. The website exemplifies the vibrant and fulfilling work of this yearâ€™s graduating cohort; welcoming new visitors, inviting conversation and creating connections between the students, our community and global audiences.
                    You can support our graduates by purchasing their artwork. Students may elect to have art available for purchase, please be aware that this is at their discretion.
                    Please direct sales and general artwork enquiries directly to each student via their online platform. We encourage you to contact the Gallery Team at soad.gallery@anu.edu.au
                    Student views are their own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Australian National University School of Art & Design.
