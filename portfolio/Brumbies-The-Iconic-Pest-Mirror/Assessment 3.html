            <div class="box"><p>As a child, seeing a brumby was an event, shaken from the boredom of a family roadtrip through the alps, into sheer excitement.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>An elusive, yet elegant creature, braving the harsh climates of Australia. The perfect analogy for high country Australians, who established a life where none thought they could.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>However, in the last two decades, the conversation of brumbies has changed from romance to controversy.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="story">
            <div class="nobox"><p>The reason? something Australia knows all to well, invasion and destruction of native land.</p></div>

            <div class="box"><p>Brumbies have been a part of Australian Alps for nearly 200 years and have defined the culture of the high country.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>Romanticized and almost deified by the locals, the brumbies significance in Australian icon is not to be underestimated, their imagery present all throughout history.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>Populations have been increasing dramatically and the cumulative damage on the native wildlife is reaching a tipping point.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>However, the aerial culling required to control the numbers is controversial for many.</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>The main home of the brumby is the Australian Alps, a mountainous region spanning across the Australian Captial Territory, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Their populations scattered across the regions of this stunning landscape.</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>A survey conducted by the Australian Alps National Parks collective in 2014 identified 3 key regions of brumby habitat, Bago-Maragle, Kosciuszko, and Byadbo-Victoria.</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Through aerial surveying, an estimate for the brumby distribution was calculated, along with a total estimated population of <strong>9187</strong>.</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>This survey was then repeated in 2019, analysing the same regions.</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>It found that in the 5 years since the last survey, the projected population of brumbies in the Australian Alps had increased by over 15,000 to an estimated <strong>25,318</strong>. </p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Meaning that the population was growing at an alarming <strong> 23%</strong> per annum</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>This was by far the most concerning statistic and the safety of the Kosciuszko eco-system was quickly becoming a concern.</p></div>

            <div class="box"><p>To understand the reason for growth, we have to look back on their history in Australia.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>The wild brumbies we see today most likely originate from Sergeant James Brumby's horses released after when transferred to Van Diemen's Land around 1806. </p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>When these horses were released, they were the first to establish a presence in the mountain that thus dubbed the name Brumby to them.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>These horses, along with escapees from owners during World War I and the Great Depression began reproduction without the domestication of humans.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="story">
            <div class="BG1"><img id="square" src="images/Damage/bdamage17.jpg" alt="ecosystem before brumby"></div>
            <div class="box"><p>When freed, the horses that survived were the ones that were calm and were able to save more calories unlike the horses with a tempered personality. </p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>This left the sturdy and calm ones to survive and reproduce as the spared calories gave them extra time to find natural resources.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>After a while, their genes have been reduced to less than 5% inbred unlike their domesticated counterparts.</p></div>
        </div> 
        <div class="story">
            <div class="nobox"><p>Initially, being released in to the wild after years of domestication on top of facing the harsh mountain environment and wildfires slowed down their reproductive numbers.</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>However, after years of tempering they have come back in full force.<p></div>

        </div>   
        <div class="story">
            <div class="BG1"><img src="images/bdamage-before.png" alt="ecosystem before brumby"></div>
            <div class="box"><p>The brumbies cause the destruction and damage of native species that slowly degrade the ecosystem.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>This also extends to animals as researchers noted the impact of reptiles and small mammals having their homes destroyed due to the trampling.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>Because ecosystem recovery is naturally slow, even the smallest numbers can have long term effects.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="story">
            <div class="BG1"><img src="images/bdamage-after.png" alt="ecosystem after brumby"></div>
            <div class="box"><p>The brumbies will trample into stream beds and damage its structure causing erosion that will leave larger dirt particles in the streams that will pollute the water once the smaller particles wash downstream.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>In addition, the trampling will remove roots which will ruin the structure of the bed entirely.</p></div>
            <div class="box"><p>Since some of these areas contain unique vegetation undisturbed by hooved animals, they've become very fragile and any brumby contact can easily destroy them.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="story">
            <div class="nobox"><p>The following pictures are a compilation of destruction evidence in Kosciuszko National Park showing the damaged water systems and patched vegetation caused by the trampling and rolling.</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Some include pathways created by the brumbies that disturbed the growth areas of the moss and grass.</p></div>

            <div class="box"><p>Professor James Pittock from the ANU Fenner School of Environment and Society, has joined many surveys of the Australian Alps as a part of a large scientific cohort aiming to protect the native wildlife of the ecosystem.</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>"The worst areas that I've seen recently are the 'pine clad ridges' rain shadow country along the Snowy River and the catchment of the upper Murrumbidgee River. " Says Pittock</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>"The damage in these places is systematic and will take decades to heal once the feral horses are removed."</p></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>"By contrast, areas protected by exclusion fences on the Victorian Bogong High Plains since the 1940s stand out with more vegetation, no erosion and a greater diversity of plant species."</p></div>

            <div class="nobox"><p>Luckily in 2021 the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service implemented a new wild horse heritage management plan for Kosciuszko national Park.</div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Which aims to control and reduce horse populations.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="storyleft">
            <div class="BGR"><img src="images/maps/aus-alps-2021-02.png" alt="a map of the australian alps with brumby distribution for NSW Action Plans"></div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>The plan has three steps retention (32% of the park), removal (21% of the park) and prevention (47% of the park). with a goal of decreasing numbers down to an estimated <strong>3000</strong> by 2027.</div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>Because of the climbing numbers, aerial culling has now become a necessary option to reduce the brumby population</div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>As seen in other countries with massive horse populations like the U.S, rehousing has been shown to be a prolonged expense and hasn't helped in controlling numbers.</div>
            <div class="nobox"><p>That aside, when that option is unavailable, the best solution is to get rid of the adults in mass than trying to manipulate their breeding patterns.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="story">
            <div class="nobox"><p>However, many researchers argue that it will be too little too late, and the only way to avoid permanent and unrecoverable damage is immediate action and to remove the brumbies in their entirety.</p></div>
