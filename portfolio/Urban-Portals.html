            <h2>Urban Portals</h2>
            <p>May 2023</p>
        </hgroup>
        <p class="first">I’ve had an interest in the urban and domestic spaces for quite a while, living in them my
            entire life, I’ve learnt to appreciate their quaint and repetitive forms. The rental that I currently live
            in is falling apart, and will be demolished in the foreseeable future, yet, for some reason I still feel
            attachment to its lonely broken-down silhouette in the developed street. I wanted to convey these feelings,
            showing that the spaces that we so often look past can be beautiful and sometimes mystical.</p>
        <p>I found that garages, often the most overlooked room of the house, provided the perfect doors to another
            world. Their square shape and their loud presence in the urban environment created a window with just enough
            room to see what could lie beyond. I find it quite amusing, as garages are quite mundane and are rarely
            perceived beyond the amount of room they have to store things. This defies the preconceptions one may have
            towards what lies beyond a garage door.</p>
        <p>My intention is to have the viewer reconsider the way they perceive urban spaces. Utilising this unexpected
            and uncanny effect to show that some things are not as boring as they seem.</p>
